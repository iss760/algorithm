# For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
# Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II.
# The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
# However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.
# Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
# The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
# Example 5:
#   Input: 1994
#   Output: "MCMXCIV"
#   Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
